Music Abstractions {#title}
===========================

Programatically Making Music with Clojure and Overtone {#subtitle}
------------------------------------------------------------------

In this presentation I used the [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/)
library for Clojure to live code a simple piece of generative music
starting from the smallest building blocks of sound. This live coding
demonstrates some of the basic principles of sound, as well as shows
off how interactive development in Clojure can be.

The video of the presentation can be found here:

All of the code used in the video can also be found on github here:

Additional Resources
--------------------

The environment I used for this presentation is using Emacs with Cider
as a Clojure IDE.

- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/)
- [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/)
- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
- [Cider](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider)

There's a fair amount of setup involved in getting everything working,
but it's a lot of fun when you do. The github repo for this
presentation includes some information on getting started with Overtone.

If you'd like to see another live demo of overtone, I very much enjoy
Chris Ford's
[Functional Composition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfsnlbd-4xQ)
presentation, which dives more into the process of making compositions
rather than simply sounds.

If you're looking for a simpler way to dip your toes into programmatic
music, the [SonicPi](http://sonic-pi.net/) project aims to be "The
Live Coding Music Synth for Everyone."
