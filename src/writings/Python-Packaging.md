Python Packaging {#title}
=========================

How to package and distribute your Python code {#subtitle}
----------------------------------------------------------

In this presentation to the Pittsburgh Python Users group, I aimed to
address the following topics:

- Turning your python code into an open source package, distributed
  and installable with pip.
- How to break up a monolithic codebase into independently managed
  packages.
- The benefits of python packaging for open source and internal
  projects.

The "Python Packaging Users Guide" is a consistently updated resource
for how to package python code, and should be your main resource for
packaging python code. It is linked below, along with some other
resources.
