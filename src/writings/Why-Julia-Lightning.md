Why Julia: A Lightning Talk {#title}
====================================

Given to Pittsburgh Code & Supply on October {#subtitle}
--------------------------------------------------------

This presentation tried to demonstrate, in 10 minutes or less, why you
might want to check out the Julia language for numeric computing. The
presentation makes the case that Julia tries to do for numeric
computing, what perl did for handling text. It focuses on the
expressive and modern features of the language, as well as its speed
and interoperability.

The slides can be found here:

Additional Resources
--------------------

The Julia language homepage does a great job of covering what's cool
about Julia, and is worth a read. I also gave a presentation
["An Introduction to Julia"](/writings/Intro-To-Julia) that covers the
features of the language more fully.
